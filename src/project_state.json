  "architectural_notes": [
    "Add support for user-specific personalization of UI copy/tone (target persona: angry woman dealing with long-term stalking).",
    "Plan secure storage/handling for evidence uploads (photos/audio/video) and associated metadata.",
    "Implement SMS prefill via deep link / OS share intent for one-tap “Send via SMS”.",
    "Define approach for police department lookup (Google integration) and a model for ‘personal’ vs ‘globally verified’ saved departments.",
    "Add PWA install guidance and ensure app is PWA-capable (manifest/service worker) if not already.",
    "User requests a black background + bright purple text color scheme (note: overrides prior preference to avoid blue/purple themes).",
    "Ensure user-facing copy updates remain safety-focused and non-violent/non-harassing (avoid wording like \"punish men\"), while still supporting an empowered, zero-tolerance anti-stalking tone.",
    "Refactor logged-in landing UI so Sign Out is rendered only once in a consistent top-right header location and never overlaps the primary CTA/hero content.",
    "When increasing tone harshness around consequences (e.g., jail), keep copy safety-focused and framed around legal accountability/documentation; avoid threats, harassment, or calls for violence.",
    "Do not store/display real-person mugshots or modified versions intended to shame/target; if adding a post-login image, use user-owned/consented imagery or symbolic/abstract graphics and keep it safety-focused."
