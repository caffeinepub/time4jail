# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the public landing page hero messaging to focus on “Document it all” and prominently display “Zero Tolerance for Stalking,” while keeping the existing authentication UI/flow unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the current hero headline/supporting copy so it no longer includes “Four Years of Hell,” and prominently includes the text “Document it all.”
- Add prominent user-facing landing page text: “Zero Tolerance for Stalking.”
- Rewrite the hero line “AI is taking the side of women to punish men for their behavior” into a women-centered, safety-focused statement about documentation/evidence organization and legal/accountability pathways, without advocating harassment, threats, violence, or “punish men” phrasing.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors to the Home/Landing page see updated hero text centered on “Document it all,” the slogan “Zero Tolerance for Stalking,” and a safer women-centered AI support statement, with login/logout behavior and buttons unchanged.
