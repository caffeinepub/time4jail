# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the post-login splash feel more intense and accountability-focused by updating the message pool and rotating generic mugshot-style fallback visuals.

**Planned changes:**
- Refresh the fixed post-login splash message list to be more assertive/“extra spicy” while staying non-profane, non-defamatory, and focused on safety, boundaries, documentation, and legal accountability.
- Replace the single static fallback splash image with a small set of generated generic mugshot-style images and randomly select one when no motivational video is available (or when video fails), while keeping existing video behavior unchanged when it loads.

**User-visible outcome:** After logging in, users see a more intense accountability-focused splash message, and (when no video plays) a randomly selected mugshot-style fallback image instead of the current single fallback.
